### :cloud: Installation

#### Requirements:
```
NodeJS
PostgreSQL server
```

**Only one step :**
```shell
npm run-script lift
```
### :pencil: Production start

Webpack builds the bundle files on `postinstall` and Beam is lifted the same way it's always lifted in production:

```shell
npm run dist
```
___

### :computer: Development

There are multiple ways to run the project in development as sails and webpack-dev-server run independently. The easiest way is to use [Foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman) (`npm install -g foreman`) and run:

```shell
nf start
```

This will start all processes listed in the `Procfile`.

The alternative is to manually run each process in separate terminal windows.

To view Beam app, go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
